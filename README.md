# Weather Forecast

## Description

This project allows you to search for a city and receive the current days weather forecast as well as see the five day forecast. This allows you to check the current weather for your city or if you have plans to go to another city to also check that city's weather as well. This project utilizes fetch and local storage as well as plenty of bootstrap. 


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

Go to the search box and search a city. In the container next to the search box the current weather should be displayed. In the small boxes below it should show the five day forecast. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
